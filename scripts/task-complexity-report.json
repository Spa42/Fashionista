      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Project with Core Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js project setup into logical phases covering initial project creation, configuration of TypeScript and Tailwind, shadcn/ui integration, and environment/folder structure setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures with well-documented tools, but requires careful configuration of multiple technologies. The complexity comes from ensuring all dependencies work together correctly rather than individual steps being difficult."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Homepage UI",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the homepage implementation into design planning, component creation, responsive layout implementation, and navigation/SEO optimization subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a visually appealing homepage with specific aesthetic requirements adds complexity. The task requires both technical implementation and design sensibility, with multiple components that need to work together responsively."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build Upload Page UI",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the upload page implementation into file upload library integration, validation logic, UI component creation, form state management, and responsive design implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves third-party library integration, complex validation logic, and state management for a multi-step process. The requirement for exactly two photos adds validation complexity, and the overall user experience is critical to the application's success."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create OpenAI API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the OpenAI integration into API route setup, environment configuration, prompt engineering, error handling, and testing/validation subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with external AI APIs involves security considerations, complex request formatting, and proper error handling. The GPT-4o vision model integration requires specific prompt engineering and handling of multiple input types (images and text)."

    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Image Processing Utilities",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down image processing utilities into validation functions, format conversion utilities, compression implementation, and preview functionality components.",
      "reasoning": "Image processing involves technical challenges like format conversion, compression, and handling browser-specific image behaviors. Creating reusable utilities that work across different contexts adds complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Conclusion Page UI",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the conclusion page development into layout design, feedback section components, loading state implementation, and error handling UI creation.",
      "reasoning": "The conclusion page requires structured organization of complex content with multiple sections. The design needs to handle various states (loading, success, error) while maintaining aesthetic consistency."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Connect Upload Form to API",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the form-to-API connection into form submission handler, data validation and preparation, API request implementation, loading state management, and navigation/state persistence logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task represents a critical integration point between frontend and backend, requiring careful state management, data transformation, and error handling. The complexity comes from coordinating multiple asynchronous processes and ensuring data integrity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Response Parsing and Display",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide response handling into parsing utilities, data categorization logic, display component integration, and fallback implementation for incomplete responses.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing unstructured AI responses requires sophisticated text processing to extract meaningful sections. The implementation needs to handle varying response formats and ensure the information is presented clearly and consistently."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Loading States and Error Handling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the loading and error handling implementation into reusable loading component creation, error message system design, and integration throughout application flow points.",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, implementing consistent loading and error states requires attention to detail across multiple components. The challenge is creating a system that's both comprehensive and maintainable."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Polish UI and Perform Final Testing",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the final polishing phase into UI refinement, responsive testing across devices, performance optimization, and end-to-end testing of complete user flows.",
      "reasoning": "Final polishing touches multiple aspects of the application and requires a holistic view. The complexity comes from addressing subtle issues across various components while ensuring everything works together seamlessly."
